## HackerRank 
More and more companies are using HackerRank challenge to process their engineering candidates. If you are not familiar with HackerRank, it provides competitive programming challenges where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications. The submission of the participants are graded according to the accuracy of its output.

## HackerRank Challenges 

- Challenges are timed, make sure you are not disturbed and focused.
20–30% of your success comes from system familiarity. Before you start the actual coding challenge, try others, e.g. algorithms warm up. Make sure you know how to execute and submit your code.
- Understand allowed programming languages for the test. If your language of choice is not available, practice another one.
- Usually there are multiple problems to solve in every challenge and its a mistake to start with the hardest one. A good approach is to solve - problems in ascending difficulty/time order. Read them briefly first and decide implementation order.
- Try to minimize switching time between problems after the implementation. You could spend extra time to make sure it’s a “final” implementation and not come back to it again.
- Every problem has public and private test cases. You score is based on both. If code implementation passed all of the public test cases, it does not meat it would pass all of the private test cases. Think about edge situations, e.g. empty input, one element input, two elements, many elements, etc. HackeRank environment allows you to run the code on your custom tests.
Submit at least something for every problem. It’s easy to capture some points even if you do not know how to solve the problem. However, if you - don’t know how to solve all the problems, try to figure out at least one.
- Home preparation makes the difference: some templates might help as you could copy-paste them during the challenge. For example, BFS/DFS/Binary search.
- Practice first as much as you can. You could try solving at least one problem from every algorithmic subdomain.
- A good result is not a magic, it’s practice and sweat.


## Full Stack Interviews Problems 
Recently i was solving some full stack certification questions and i found those interesting 
Questions are simpler but they looks very lengthy as they provided initial boilerplate code 
You can give a a try as they will help in getting you placed in good companies 

## Types of Coding Problems 

- Data structure and Algo (Needs Expertise)
- Technology Based question (SQL, NODEJS, REACT, ANGULAR)

Technology based question can be easy as you are familiar with that framework or technology and these days interviews also focusing on 
full stack based problems like problem in nodejs, react, angular
Now i will give you best possible way to help and improve on those type of tests 
Try certification questions  you can try sample test to get familiar with HackerRank system

- node js certification basic
- node js certification intermediate 
- angular basic certification 
- angular advance certification
- Certification for APIs
- Certification for SQL
- Certification for react basic and intermediate
-  and many more .....
