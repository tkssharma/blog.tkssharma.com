The event was centered around DevOps, for our talk Docker Saigon needed to interest an engineering audience with how things tick on the inside of Docker. Audience experience with Docker and Linux operating systems was expected.</small>

Once we are done with Docker, then we can start Looking for Kubernetes, its Architecture deployment and all about it as its most popular tool to Orchestration of Containers.

[\*\*Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) is an open-source system for automating\*\* deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon [15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
