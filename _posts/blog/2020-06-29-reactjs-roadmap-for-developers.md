# ReactJS Roadmap ðŸ—º For Developers.ðŸ’» ðŸ”­ ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽº

The [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) or React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It has grown as one of the best libraries in recent years for component-based GUI development.

Although, there are other front-end frameworks like Angular and Vue.js available, what sets React apart from others is, it just focuses on component-based GUI development and doesnâ€™t invade other areas.

Below is the chart demonstrating the paths that you can take and the libraries that you would want to learn to become a React developer. This chart is made by [Adam GoÅ‚Ä…b](https://twitter.com/adam_devops).

> Note: **This roadmap will give you an idea about the landscape and guide you if you are confused about where to begin or what to learn next. In the end, it depends on your experience as you will grow some understanding of why one tool is better suited for some cases than the other one. It is not necessary that handy and trendy one is always perfect. So, go through the map and start developing.**
