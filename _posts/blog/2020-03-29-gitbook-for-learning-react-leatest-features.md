Course Objectives: What You’ll Learn
------------------------------------

React js  is a client side UI building library  to develop web based applications.React is a library developed by Facebook, and it is designed to build large applications with data that changes over time. Developers can use ReactJS to create user interfaces (UI) with high performance, where React would automatically manage all UI updates. React is all about building reusable web components,

Objective is  End to end development training  to enable associate build a full-fledged application with React + Redux + Redis + micro-services, Redux Store, Redux Thunk and Redux promises

We will talk about ES5/ES6 transpilers and hands-on on React application with Routing and different npm packages for building application

- React.js Fundamentals with ES6 & Web pack with Code examples
- React Redux + Immutable hands-on
- React App testing using Frameworks
- Develop App using Redux React
- Working within in a dynamic, hands-on learning environment, attendees will be able to:
-Understand React js  Framework
- Using React JS  components and their lifecycle
- Using components and creating real time apps
- Using Routing to create single page app
- Using es5 and es6 to write React apps
- Using Redux as state container for react apps
- Develop Redux container components and using middlewares with Redux.
- Testing React Components and testing Redux layer
- Course Structure: This program is an experiential program to develop knowledge and skills - through practical examples
