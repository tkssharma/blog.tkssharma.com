Enter this journey with an open mind and no preconceptions on how you can utilise what you already know about coding from another language.

Follow these steps to get familiar with javascript

**Step 01:** Start from beginning and learn how to write javascript code , how to declare variable javascript , functions, calling function and writing simple code snippets and executing them (You can just open chrome console by right click on browser screen and inspect and start wiring code)

*   Start from here : [“JavaScript for Cats”](http://jsforcats.com/), [Max Ogden](https://twitter.com/maxogden) free website, for fresh start.
*   Now check this out : [FreeCodeCamp’s 10-hour Basic JavaScript track](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript) only basic javascript

**Step 02:** Let’s move forward and refrain our knowledge on javascript here we have good resources on javascript by [Kyle Simpson](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/you-dont-know-js-book-series/creator_bio) on git repos.

This is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language. Fow now you can start with first two Books. These book starts off explaining the basic principles of programming at a very high level. It’s mostly intended if you are starting YDKJS with little to no prior programming experience

*   Read online (free!): [“Up & Going”](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going), Published: available on GIt
*   Read online (free!): [“Scope & Closures”](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures), Published: available on GIt

**Step 03:** Let’s move forward and get more into javascript world and understand prototypal object oriented features of javaScript with functional programming (blogs from Eric)

*   [“The Two Pillars of JavaScript Part 1”](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3) on Prototypal OO, Eric Elliott (article, free)
*   [“The Two Pillars of JavaScript Part 2”](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4) on Functional Programming (article, free)
*   [Up & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) After this here we can go into much details about prototype and object oriented features .You will see Objects in JavaScript have an internal property, denoted in the specification as \[\[Prototype\]\], which is simply a reference to another object. Almost all objects are given a non-null value for this property, at the time of their creation.

**Step 04:** Now you should have knowledge on these topics of javascript

Some Important aspects of ES5 which you should be aware of

1.  Understanding Javascript Function and Invocation
2.  Javascript Function Arguments and function return
3.  Different Ways of Invocation of Function
4.  Introduction of Function Prototype
5.  JavaScript Function Argument Object
6.  Understanding Javascript Closure
7.  Javascript Function Chaining
8.  Prototypal inheritance
