# Microservice Architecture and Design Patterns for Microservices

Microservices can have a positive impact on your enterprise. Therefore it is worth to know that, how to handle Microservice Architecture (MSA) and some Design Patterns for Microservices. General goals or principles for a microservice architecture. Here are the four goals to consider in Microservice Architecture approach [1].

1. Reduce Cost: MSA will reduce the overall cost of designing, implementing, and maintaining IT services.

1. Increase Release Speed: MSA will increase the speed from idea to deployment of services.

1. Improve Resilience: MSA will improve the resilience of our service network.

1. Enable Visibility: MSA support for better visibility on your service and network.

You need to understand what principles microservice architecture has been built

 Scalability

 Availability

 Resiliency

 Flexibility

 Independent, autonomous

 Decentralized governance

 Failure isolation

 Auto-Provisioning

 Continuous delivery through DevOps

Add hearing to the above principles, brings several challenges and issues while bring your solution or system to live. Those problems are common for many solutions. Those can overcome with using correct and matching design patterns. There are design patterns for microservices and those can divide into five Patterns. Each many contains many patterns. Below diagram shows the those.
